# Torque Plugin for Android Auto

This is a performance monitor based on [Chillout's Performance Monitor](https://github.com/jilleb/mqb-pm) which was based on Martoreto's aa-stats.
The app has been modified with a focus on making it more customizable with the ability
to obtain any PID from Torque. Torque pro is required to use this app.

## Install

Note: Do not open a bug for an installation issue. You need to bypass restrictions put in place by Google to get this app working on Android Auto. These instructions will work for most phones. I can not troubleshoot every phone.

To use the application you must be added to the google play testing program to do this simply go to [Get Your Email Added Discussion](https://github.com/Inside4ndroid/aa-torque-ex/discussions/2) and leave a comment with your email and i will add you to the list of testers.

you must then use this link to join the testers program and download the app from google play :

[Join using a web browser](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.aatorque.carstats)

## Using
- Open the AA Torque settings, grant all the rights it's requesting. If you don't do this, the app will NOT work.
- Hook your phone to your car's USB, start Android Auto on your unit.
- You can find the AA Torque in the menu on the lower right in Android Auto, the one with the dashboard clock on it.

## Compiling in Android Studio

To get instructions please see the [Android Studio Documentation](https://github.com/Inside4ndroid/aa-torque-ex/blob/master/ASDocs.md).

after uploading you can then create your own list of testers to use the application.
